# OpenReplay

[OpenReplay](https://openreplay.com/) advertises itself as Open Source while [mostly being based on the Elastic License 2](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/blob/7fc8fab4d7d40248f7a22ca076ea9d0d12179c6e/LICENSE). The license prevents:

- Provision to third parties as a hosting or managed service.
- Modification/circumvention of any license key mechanisms.

I [queried the license on GitHub](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/issues/638). No direct response or confirmation was provided regarding the use of "Open Source". They did confirm to another user that they did indeed announce the license change (from MIT) 7 minutes into a monthly community call video, albeit not on their newsletter or releases page at the time.

The opened issue was converted into a discussion, with that discussion being deleted a couple of years later. [Archive Link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240820070828/https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/discussions/656), [Screenshot](../files/openreplay-discussion-656.png).

I later found I was [blocked from their organization on GitHub](../files/openreplay-blocked-github.png), with the reason stated (link from the GitHub message) being that discussion thread I opened.
