# Runa Capital

[Runa Capital](https://runacap.com/), a VC firm, [maintains a list](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) of "Awesome open-source alternatives to SaaS". When looking further, this is specifically a list of start-up companies to a specific criteria that likely works to their investment focus.

This list contains a mix of many non-Open-Source products/companies. I [raised this in a GitHub issue](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives/issues/143) but as of writing there's been little intent to update the list. The fact that some of the projects/companies, in question, are also investments of Runa Capital may be a point of hesitation. 

Runa Capital also publish Open Source specific lists, [such as this one](https://runacap.com/ross-index/q2-2022/), which contain [similar points of confusion](https://twitter.com/ssddanbrown/status/1551307892229283841).

Edit: Runa [continue to push](https://twitter.com/ssddanbrown/status/1620855608655364096) non open source via their "ross" lists. [Claim they](https://twitter.com/vinogradovk/status/1620888050447581185) follow "commercial" open source instead of "orthodox" which makes this fine, but they won't define their definition/line for what counts. One of the projects listed is not even source available, many are quite restrictive (No commercial).
