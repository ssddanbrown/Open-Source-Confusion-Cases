# Cal.com

The [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) project on GitHub is licensed as AGPLv3. Within [the readme](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/58c4c894fd48d1b299d89e5fc9e1677f3b690bb8/README.md?plain=1#L100) is, what I believe to be, a misrepresentation of the AGPLv3 in the interest of pointing people to commercial licenses. The first item of the development setup details the following: 

> 1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE). To clone in a private repository, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales))

As far as I can tell, nothing within the AGPLv3 requires the source code to be kept public (unless publicly distributing) and nothing prevents code being cloned in a private repository.

I discovered this after a Redditor had shared their project with a similar confused statement, believing the AGPLv3 worked in this way, after using the cal.com repo for reference. I [queried this](../files/cal-com-license-slack.png) on the project's slack chat but things got stuck in a loop. After a post of mine, containing this license interpretation example, was [posted on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31897648) the cofounder of cal.com [responded with some further insight](../files/cal-com-agpl3-hn-comments.png) and updated the readme wording to the line posted above, which is perhaps more confusing than it was before.
