# Nango

[Nango](https://www.nango.dev/) is an integration platform which advertises itself as open source while under the [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/6a2e1986913a4a9081971a072dc4a66cdb695e66/LICENSE) which prevents:

- Provision to third parties as a hosting or managed service.
- Modification/circumvention of any license key mechanisms.

They advertise as open source:

- In their readme [[ref]](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/6a2e1986913a4a9081971a072dc4a66cdb695e66/README.md?plain=1#L113-L119)
- On their website [[ref]](https://www.nango.dev/)
- In their docs [[ref]](https://docs.nango.dev/integrations/overview)
- On Reddit [[ref]](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/10rts84/opensource_service_to_easily_get_store_refresh/)

I initially [queried this on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/10rts84/comment/j6xj5tm/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with no response.
I later queried this [on their GitHub project](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/900) for which I got little direct response, although a member of the project [did respond](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/900#issuecomment-1693085929) to another user justifying their case of using "open source", including:

> Our opinion is that preventing copy cats is fair and the resulting software is undoubtedly more on the side of open-source than close-source.

They did not respond to further comments there, but later closed this issue to indicate it's been moved to their internal issue tracker. I [queried this again on hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38211490) from which they indicated intent to change wording, but at 80 days later at the time of writing, and almost a year on from the original Reddit query, they are still labelling themselves as open source.

It looks like they may have scaled back some of open source wording, like multiple mentions of being "100% open source" on their website [[ref]](https://web.archive.org/web/20230421202413/https://www.nango.dev/), but they still have multiple references to open source on their website that could be seen as reflecting them being open source, and therefore be potentially misleading, including [on their homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20240128122604/https://www.nango.dev/):
