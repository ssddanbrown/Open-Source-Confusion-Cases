# Erxes

The [Erxes project](https://github.com/erxes/erxes) commonly refers to itself as the "Open Source Hubspot alternative". At the time of writing the project is license under an [AGPLv3 License with some custom additions](https://github.com/erxes/erxes/blob/3b8c7c66fe339011b0d88eaa504db08f27c86549/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L5-L8) . One of these is as follows:

> erxes is not permitted to be hosted as a SaaS version to compete with erxes Inc.

I queried this [via their GitHub discussions](https://web.archive.org/web/20220830185114/https://github.com/erxes/erxes/discussions/3552) but they removed discussions at some point, which removed my query. I re-raised my query via [an issue](https://github.com/erxes/erxes/issues/3667) but did not yet have a response at time of writing. 

The usage of "Open Source" was also [raised in a previous issue](https://github.com/erxes/erxes/issues/2538) when the project was [using the Commons Clause](https://github.com/erxes/erxes/blob/8d578e9fdb093c2f6155a139b445ca1fa81c060a/LICENSE.md).
