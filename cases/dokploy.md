# Dokploy

[Dokploy](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy) is a PaaS project which advertises as open source across [their website](https://dokploy.com/), [GitHub project](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy) and [marketing via Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40195480).

At the time of writing, the project is under a [modified Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/blob/be56ba046cb3b2b8676d5f8020cf56844d601730/LICENSE.MD) which adds many additional terms as multiple appendices, many of which limit freedoms and/or conflict with the Apache license itself, and subsequently go against the open source definition.

I queried this via [their GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/discussions/3), in which user [`@sbuttgereit` noted](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/discussions/3#discussioncomment-9264180) that this modification of the Apache license goes against the terms of use for the license. The discussion was closed & locked a couple of weeks later with no official response.
