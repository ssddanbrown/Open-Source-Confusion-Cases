# Uptrace

[Uptrace](https://uptrace.dev/) is an APM tool that markets itself as [Open Source](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace/blob/8a5a11e592e46f7def3e14b9cd21318c4d9c35d5/README.md) while using a [BSL license](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace/blob/8a5a11e592e46f7def3e14b9cd21318c4d9c35d5/LICENSE) that has not yet passed its change date for any past version. The license prevents certain commercial usages, specifically: 

> ... may not use the Licensed Work for a Tracing and Metrics Service.

I came across this project via [a Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/xw2urw/comment/ir4dzpc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where the license was discussed. The user that posted the project was combatative in respect to the project not being Open Source, and at one stage made the following remark:

> Again all true, but being honest about definitions does not make end users happier or the product more open and approachable.
> But it can scare people away or put your product in a less favorite light while practically for end users there is little to no difference.

The project also doubles down on their usage by [stating the following](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace/blob/8a5a11e592e46f7def3e14b9cd21318c4d9c35d5/README.md?plain=1#L75-L78) in the readme:

> Are you open-source?
> Technically, the BSL license is classified as source-available, but we will continue to use the term open-source on the basis that the source code is open. Our competitors do the same.
