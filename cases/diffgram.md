# Diffgram

[Diffgram](https://diffgram.com) advertises itself as Open Source while using [a license](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/054c22057ae38f8319a259bd7cbbd329611a470c/LICENSE.md) that's "Elastic License v2" based, but with much more restrictive conditions. The license prevents: 

- Provision to third parties
- Hosting to third parties
- Distribution
- Competing with Diffgram in the "Training Data Software market"
- Commercial use with certain user/employee counts

I [queried the license](../files/diffgram-slack-license-query-thread.png) on the Diffgram slack thread where it was confirmed that their use against the OSI definition was known, and I was pointed to [their readme section](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/versions#open-source-history) on the matter which has some self-justification in their use. I was [later banned](../files/diffgram-email-slack-ban.png) from their slack group after their marketing practices were queried.

### November 2023 Update

It looks like the project has now moved to a [custom licensing setup](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/f964659d09f5ab15a1dc4b931288db25cdd62c5f/LICENSE.md) which is still very limiting but no longer conflating the ELv2.

Some of the open source advertising may have also been removed but there's still some references to this as open source:

- [In the readme](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/f964659d09f5ab15a1dc4b931288db25cdd62c5f/README.md?plain=1#L43).
- [In the docs](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/open-source)

In the docs they're trying to insist open source via the COSS excuse:

>  Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is different from Commercial Open Source Software (COSS). Diffgram is COSS.
