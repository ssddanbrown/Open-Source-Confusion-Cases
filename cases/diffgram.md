# Diffgram

[Diffgram](https://diffgram.com) advertises itself as Open Source while using [a license](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/054c22057ae38f8319a259bd7cbbd329611a470c/LICENSE.md) that's "Elastic License v2" based, but with much more restrictive conditions. The license prevents: 

- Provision to third parties
- Hosting to third parties
- Distribution
- Competing with Diffgram in the "Training Data Software market"
- Commercial use with certain user/employee counts

I [queried the license](../files/diffgram-slack-license-query-thread.png) on the Diffgram slack thread where it was confirmed that their use against the OSI definition was known, and I was pointed to [their readme section](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/versions#open-source-history) on the matter which has some self-justification in their use. I was [later banned](../files/diffgram-email-slack-ban.png) from their slack group after their marketing practices were queried.
