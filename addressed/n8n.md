# n8n

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) used to advertise themselves as Open Source, while understanding the project is not Open Source (Due to using the [Commons Clause](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/8ec557d7cbf84391f1b453aa7a46c17c76ec2288/LICENSE.md), and later the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/521cf51e7cfb73ad60650b72206083d4c2666d29)), having a [section of their documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20191010045840/https://docs.n8n.io/#/faq) (FAQ > License section) to justify their usage.

Drew Devault reported and re-iterated this manipulation of Open Source usage in what was a [rather heated GitHub issue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/40).

Eventually n8n changed wording to use "Fair-code" instead but there remains a lot of confusion since much historical content still refers to n8n as "Open Source".
