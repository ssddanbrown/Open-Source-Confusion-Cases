# Dub

[Dub](https://github.com/dubinc/dub) were licensed under an AGPLv3 license but had the following text in their docs:

> First, clone the Dub repo into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our AGPLv3 license.

This is quite similar to, and likely copied from, the [cal.com](../cases/cal-com.md) scenario.

I raised this via [a GitHub issue on the project](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/1015) and the maintainer was quick with a response and eager to prevent misrepresentation of the AGPL, quickly updating the text to be correct to the license.
