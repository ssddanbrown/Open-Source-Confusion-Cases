# Easy Redmine

[Easyredmine](https://www.easyredmine.com/) advertised themselves as "100% Open source" [on their homepage](../files/easy-redmine-home.png), while [their FAQ page](../files/easy-redmine-faq.png) specifically advised certain assets are not provided under GPL but instead under a proprietary license. 

I [emailed them](../files/easy-readmine-email.png) about this misleading statement. While I did not get a response, the homepage was updated in the weeks after.
