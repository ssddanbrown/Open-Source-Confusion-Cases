# Helicone

[Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) advertised their project as open source via multiple sources including their repo, hacker news, and their website, but the project was under the commons clause.

When [this was raised](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/discussions/165) they were understanding and quickly reverted back to an Apache 2.0 License.
