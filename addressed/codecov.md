# Codecov

[Codecov](codecov.io) announced themselves as open source [on their blog](https://about.codecov.io/blog/codecov-is-now-open-source/) while under a [Business Source License](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-api/blob/aa7ee5df73df2bfde9ffbddd83a65849dae34569/LICENSE) while added limits to use for a certain time.

After [backlash on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36971490) and [thread on GitHub](https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues/48) they eventually changed to avoid marketing as "open source", although they did initially try to skirt around this with [some justification as to why they can market as open-source](https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues/48#issuecomment-1662980660).

With some [further prompting needed](https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues/48#issuecomment-1664756082) in the GitHub thread, they updated wording across their site & content.

Codecov is owned by Sentry which is also [tracked in this project](../cases/sentry.md).
