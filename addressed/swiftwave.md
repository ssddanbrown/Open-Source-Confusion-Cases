# Swiftwave

[Swiftwave](https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave) is a PaaS solution which was made available under the Apache2 license [with some extra terms attached](https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave/blob/f2d3ebd3cec3fa797283cca7c263cc986fa10615/LICENSE):

> If there is any conflict, the rules in this section are more important than the usual rules of the Apache License.
> \- Without a special written agreement, you can't modify the paid features of SwiftWave.
> \- Without a special written agreement, you can't share or sell another paid version of SwiftWave.
> \- Also, if you change the free features of SwiftWave and want to redistribute, you have to share those changes for free and need to keep the changes open source.

These extra rules directly prevented open modification & distribution, while also going against the terms of the Apache license since the terms are not longer actually to the original Apache license when taken as a whole.

I [queried this on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d4c6l4/comment/l6fsplq/), and also [opened a more direct discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/swiftwave-org/discussions/680) with more detail.

The author noted this was originally copied from the [Caprover project](https://github.com/caprover/caprover) who do the same.

The author was open to feedback and quick to change their license to a standard Apache license.
