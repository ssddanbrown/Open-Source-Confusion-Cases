# Addressed Cases

This page lists cases that were raised with the project authors, but soon addressed upon notification.
This list is retained as positive examples of projects/authors that are understanding and receptive to feedback.

### Helicone

[Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) advertised their project as open source via multiple sources including their repo, hacker news, and their website, but the project was under the commons clause.
When [this was raised](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/discussions/165) they were understanding and quickly reverted back to an Apache 2.0 License.

### Easy Redmine

[Easyredmine](https://www.easyredmine.com/) advertised themselves as "100% Open source" [on their homepage](files/easy-redmine-home.png), while [their FAQ page](files/easy-redmine-faq.png) specifically advised certain assets are not provided under GPL but instead under a proprietary license. 

I [emailed them](files/easy-readmine-email.png) about this misleading statement. While I did not get a response, the homepage was updated in the weeks after.
